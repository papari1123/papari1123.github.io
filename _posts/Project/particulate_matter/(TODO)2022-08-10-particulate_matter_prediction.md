# Research-of-Particulate-Matter-Prediction-Modeling-Based-on-Deep-Learning

## 1.Summary
- The goal of this study is **to develop a deep learning-based PM prediction model using China PM data, domestic meteorological data and domestic pollution data** to consider the environment in South Korea.  </br>
- To do this, we propose a **Deep Particulate Matter Network** with a Separated Input model based on deep learning by **using ConvGRU, which can simultaneously analyze spatiotemporal information to consider the diffusion of particulate matter**.</br>
- This study used three main novel method to increase prediction accuracy (see 6.model). <br/>
- Experiments are designed **to predict the PM10 over the next N hour (N=1,4,12,24) with a spatial resolution of 8x10 grids over all regions in Korea**. The proposed Deep-learning model shows better prediction performance than the previous deep learning (LSTM, CNN+LSTM, ConvLSTM) based models .</br>

## 3.Work flow
- All meteorological data and pollution data in Korea were **mapped to an 8x10 2-D spatial grid as shown below**. The data for each region were generated by averaging all measured data in the region. <br/> 
 <br/>

 </p> 
 
 - The temporal predictors, including the season and hours of the day were mapped with the same value to all regions<br/>
 - The spatial predictors, including the x coordinate and y coordinate were individually mapped to each region based on the rows and columns of the grid. <br/>
 - In the case of the China data, for which do not have 2-D spatial information, This study used a forward-fix to interpolate between data points. This method estimates the missing value with the most recently measured value.
 - **The collected data have some unmeasured values**, since measuring stations are neither co-located nor uniformly distributed. Domestic data have 2-D spatial information, so this study **used the Inverted Distance Weight (IDW) method** to interpolate between these data.

## 6.Model
#### input part
- With **the previous 24 hours of data, This model predicts the next r hours PM concentration** in each region divided by an 8x10 grid in South Korea.  </br>
  - The **terrain part (T)** extracts features based on individual region-dependent characteristic data **using domestic meteorological data and pollution data**.  </br>
  - The **Wind part (W)** extracts features based on domestic PM diffusion by wind u**sing domestic wind component data and PM data.** </br>
  - The **China part (C)** extracts features based on **external inflow using data related to China**. </br>
- The parentheses in the input parts represent the input dimensions. **The T and W parts use the 4-D tensor data, including time and space dimensions** (time-step, x coordinate in grid, y coordinate in grid, input feature). **The C part uses the 3-D tensor data, including only the spatial dimension** (x coordinate in grid, y coordinate in grid, input feature).</br>
- **The parentheses in all layers represent the output dimension**, and the last dimension is the number of filters in each layer. **The square brackets** in some layers that use the convolution operation **represent the kernel size** for the 2-D spatial axis.</br>

#### model description
1. It was designed with mutually exclusive features extracted at the lowest level through **partitioned three input to separately consider each influencing factor (i.e., region dependent factor, diffusion factor and external influent factor) in more detail**. <br/>
2. It used **the Convolutional Gate Recurrent Unit (ConvGRU) (which can analyze 3-D spatiotemporal information at the same time) to consider diffusion phenomena and reduce the high memory usage** and computational complexity of ConvLSTM. <br/>
3. It used a **locally connected layer, which can extract independent features on the specific receptive field more effectively than a convolutional layer for analyzing how external inflow of a PM affects individual regions** in more detail.<br/>
